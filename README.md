This Program gives a detailed review of costs and earnings when investing in certain properties with the goal of renting. The user must input the property information, such as sale price, monthly HOA, and State, and loan information, such as down payment (%), loan type, and interest rate. The user must also insert their estimated monthly rent. With this information, the program will calculate the initial investment needed for the property and the yearly investment using the yearly taxes, HOA, principal, and interest. Based on the yearly investment and yearly rent, the program will indicate if the property is profitable or not. This program was creating using the programming language Python.
